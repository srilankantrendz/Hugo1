Hi there ...

Colloquial Singaporean English, better known as Singlish, is an English-based creole language spoken in Singapore. 
The term Singlish is a blend of Singaporean slang and English and was first recorded in 1973. 

As English is one of Singapore's official languages, Singlish is regarded as 
having 
low prestige.
